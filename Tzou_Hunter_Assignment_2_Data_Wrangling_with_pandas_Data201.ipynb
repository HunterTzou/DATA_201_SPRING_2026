    "- Use pandas equivalents of `dplyr` verbs:\n",
    "  - `filter()` → boolean indexing / `.loc[]`\n",

    "  - `group_by()` → `.groupby()`\n",
    "  - `summarise()` → `.agg()`\n",
    "  - `arrange()` → `.sort_values()`\n",
    "- Apply boolean logic correctly using `&` and `|`\n",
    "- Use **method chaining** for readable, step-by-step transformations\n",
    "- Create grouped summary tables with multiple statistics\n",

    "1. Keeps only observations where `price > 250000`\n",
    "2. Keeps only homes with `size > 1000`\n",
    "3. Creates a new variable:\n",
    "   - `price_per_sqft = price / size`\n",
    "4. Groups by `neighborhood`\n",

    "- Do NOT create intermediate variables (`df2`, `df3`, etc.)\n",
